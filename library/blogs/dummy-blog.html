                "See, what happens is when you start interecting less then the bond quickly turns into awkwardness then neither of the parties are able to open up or share anything properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter how much anyone says that real friends stays the same but the truth in my opinion is that when life happens and we need someone to lean towards, we look for the ones who are still around and not the ones who have been for the longest time. And then eventually, we forget the ones who are not in the small vicinity of ours."

            Found this above conversation somewhere months back on Twitter and for some reason I saved it because I strongly believed in it. And recently turns out I was not wrong because this is how most of my old friends have now just became phone contacts and some not even that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned the hard way that bonds have never been about anything magical but a simple thing and that is efforts. It definitely strengthens the bond over the time but it's a mistake to assume that one day it'll be enough and you can just keep it like that without putting more...
        </p>
        <p>
            This is something that I have been doing for a long time.
        </p>
        <h3>Why all this?</h3>
        <p>
            Only to realise that it doesn't take as much time for all that to dismantle as it took to build it up.

            P.S.- I don’t do edits really, so excuse typos and things that don’t make sense.

            This is more like a personal note. Period.
